# bfileio
This project contains two classes:
  * _com.omnirover.java.bfileio.**BinaryReader**_
  * _com.omnirover.java.bfileio.**BinaryWriter**_

The primary use of these classes is to provide similar functionaity in java as I used to get in .Net, while working with binary files.

* BinaryWriter has only **one** overloaded method called '_**write()**_', that takes every the primary type in java.
* BinaryReader has simple methods for reading Integer, Floats and every the primary types.
  For example to read Integers you call '_**readInteger()**_' method, and for reading Double just call '_**readDouble()**_' and so on.
